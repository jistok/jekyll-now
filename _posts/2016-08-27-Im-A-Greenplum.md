title: I'm a Greenplum, I'm a Netezza
---

I travel.  A lot.  This means that I get the opportunity to watch a lot of Movies, TV, Internet, Commercials, etc.  When you are as lucky as me to do that, it gives you ideas.  Some of those ideas are awesome.  For example, I was recently reminded of the clever, funny <a href="">I'm a Mac, I'm a PC</a> commercials from Apple many years ago.  

In that spirit, I really wanted to spoof them in some way that was true to form, but more relevant to things that I work on directly (Mac, long before these commercials, won the PC battle for me).

</ul>

I plan to write a separate post about each of these, some thoughts around
