title: I'm a Greenplum, I'm a Netezza - Episode 1
---

The first video we shot was a spoof off of this commercial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdrpRBFTBDg">here</a>.

The similarities are, thanks to my lack of creative genius, quite striking.  If I were to paraphrase the action, Greenplum is looking at 
a quote and Netezza snatched the article to see for himself.  Much to Netezza's jealousy and anooyance, it's a quote from InfoWorld about how
it's latest move to Opensource is a gamechanger.  Netezza then very obviously makes up a quote about himself, from a very ficticious source, and hilarity
insues.
